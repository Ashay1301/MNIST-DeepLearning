# MNIST Deep Learning


An implementation of multilayer neural network using keras with an Accuracy: mean=96.058 

## Description:

The goal of this project was to become familiar with deep networks. For this project, I have implemented deep convolutional networks to classify handwritten digits. I have also carefully analyzed the hyperparameter tuning and assessed the performance of the network with different configurations.

## Steps:

1. Import the libraries and load the dataset: Importing the necessary libraries, packages and MNIST dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Create the model
4. Train and Evaluate the Model
5. Saving the model
6. Make Predictions
